Registration is **free**<!-- and will be open until `r REGISTRATION_ENDS`-->. To be considered for a presentation, you must register and submit an abstract by `r SUBMISSION_ENDS`. 
Abstracts may be uploaded during the registration process, and should follow the formatting guidelines described below. All abstracts will be reviewed by the [organizers](https://medicine.yale.edu/lab/kleinstein/people/). Acceptance is based on scientific content and relevance to the meeting goal, which is to showcase 
the use of a variety of the Immcantation tools in advancing knowledge of adaptive immune responses. *Abstracts should state explicitly how Immcantation was used in the research.*

Selected speakers will be contacted by email by `r CONTACT_SPEAKERS`.
