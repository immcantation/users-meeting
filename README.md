## Draft website for the Immcantation User Group Meeting

To build the site you probably will need to install `fontawesome`:

```
devtools::install_github("rstudio/fontawesome")
```

Then, use the `Build Website` button from rstudio or use `rmarkdown::render_site(encoding = 'UTF-8')`. This will create the folder `_site`, with the website inside. Once we have a final version of the website, I will create a bitbucket.io site. We can not make a public site until all information and dates are final. Then once we have the final schedule, I will update again the public website.
